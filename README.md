# VisionCam

ðŸ“¸ Easily add computer vision to your SwiftUI app ðŸ“¸

VisionCam simplifies the process of building SwiftUI camera apps that utilize computer vision.  It handles most of the boilerplate ``AVCaptureSession`` setup and input/output connection as well as UIKit -> SwiftUI integration with ``UIViewControllerRepresentable``.  Take a deeper look at the architecture below for a high level view of how the system is built or jump straight to the usage and see how easy it is to use in your app.

## Usage

### Face Detection and Tracking

To easily detect and track all faces within the camera feed, use the ``FaceCam`` view.  

You can do this like any other SwiftUI view (i.e. adding to the ``rootViewController`` in the ``SceneDelegate`` class)

```swift
    // In the scene(_,session:,connectionOptions:) method within your SceneDelegate class
    // add FaceCam() to the root UIHostingController
    
    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        //...
        
        let cam = FaceCam()
    
        let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
        window.rootViewController = UIHostingController(rootView: FaceCam())
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()
        
        //...
    }
```
